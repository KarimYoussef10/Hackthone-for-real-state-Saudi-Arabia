Exploring the Relationship Between Housing Features and Rental Prices in Saudi Cities – Hackathon Project

Welcome to our project submission for the Hackathon on Analyzing the Relationship Between Housing Features and Rental Prices in Saudi Arabia. This project focuses on analyzing the residential rental market in four major cities using interactive analytics tools in Power BI.

🚀 Project Overview

The project aims to explore the relationship between housing features (such as location, area, number of rooms, and age) and rental prices in the following cities:
